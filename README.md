# whooping-crane-model [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/NicMcPhee/whooping-crane-model.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/NicMcPhee/whooping-crane-model)

Modeling management choices and outcomes for whooping crane nesting in Wisconsin.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and build with `grunt`. Then you should be able to load the `index.html` file and run the model.

There are a set of parameters that you can set. Clicking the "Start!" button
starts the simulator, which runs a number of independent simulations (currently
50), each of which simulates the population for a number of years (currently
100), plotting the population size for each year of each simulation.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

## Release History

 - [v0.8, 5 Sep 2015](https://github.com/NicMcPhee/whooping-crane-model/releases/tag/v0.8): Full version of the model with a usable but limited GUI.
